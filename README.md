# About the game 
Animal crossing new horizons is a life simulation game released by Nintendo for Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2020. It is the fifth main series title in the Animal Crossing series and, with 5 million digital copies sold, has broken the record for Switch title with the most digital units sold in a single month. In New Horizons, the player assumes the role of a customizable character who moves to a deserted island. Taking place in real-time, the player can explore the island in a nonlinear fashion, gathering and crafting items, catching insects and fish, and developing the island into a community of anthropomorphic animals.
# The Dataset 
This dataset comes from a comprehensive Item Catalog for Animal Crossing New Horizons (ACNH). As described by Wikipedia, listed on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset). For this exploratory data analysis project, I removed various items that you can’t buy, sell, or craft in the game. My data set includes accessories, clothes, flooring, wallpaper, rugs, music, art, and tools to analyze what items and DIYs are the most profitable when sold.

# Conclusion 
The Gold DIYs are the most profitable items in the game. The player can craft the items for free, if they collect all the items needed to make the Gold DIY. Gold nuggets appear by hitting rocks with an axe or shovel. Another profitable item is the robot hero. You can buy the robot hero recipe with Nook Miles at Residence Services. Nook Miles typically don’t cost the player anything and can be easily collected by completing simple tasks. As an Animal Crossing player, this information is useful for my gameplay. I learned that crafting in animal crossing is one of the best ways to make money.
